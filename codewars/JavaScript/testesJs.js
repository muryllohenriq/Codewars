// Take it from someone who learned how to code without the help of anyone:
// Coding is not too different than things you already know, it's just a language used to express your understanding of how to solve a problem, the first step is to "imagine" the steps of solving the problem in your head, you can do that using "common sense" and step by step procedures of breaking down a complex parts into smaller ones, after that what is left is learning what keys to press on your keyboard to "translate" the solution into computer language.
// you will NEVER be able to code something that you didn't solved in your head firsthand.
